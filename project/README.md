## Projet ADA : Digital Tears




# Abstract

Today, world news are closely followed, discussed, commented on different social media platforms. As a result, our group expresses a great interest into linking both the coverage of an event by the traditional media, and the following reaction of the population through social media. 

Following this idea, we still have to refine our scope; we want to focus on the impact that 
tragic events have on the internet sphere, and more precisely on the Twitter community.
Indeed, we have seen throughout the last few years that powerful waves of compassion have often followed serious worldwide-covered events. How, and why do those trends start, and do they always grow independently of the event characteristics ? Can tweets be representative of the general consensus on those matters ? By studying both big events coverage and their internet aftermath, we hope to be able to highlight some difference in reaction and coverage depending on the characteristics of the events.

Ideally, we want to use a traditional media database as our main source of events, to then work with the collected events and their related tweets. We will complement the events database, if needed, with information from Twitter.


# Research questions

* How are tragic events treated differently regarding on where they happened in the world ?
* Does the reaction get bigger for more disastrous events ?
* How is the reaction per country linked to the country where the event happened ? In other words, how (less) do people care about events happening in foreign countries, compared to their homeland ?

# Dataset

News On The Web, Twitter Dataset

# List of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

* Learn how the Twitter data set is working, how to treat so much data
* Learn how to locate the events in the news
* If the news from the web is too hard to treat, use the twitter news accounts to get the news
* Gain more insight about the data
* Adapt our research questions
 
# Questions for TAs

* Are we going to learn how to treat “raw” text or should we try to find out on our own ? That means is it possible to use the news dataset as it is, is there a way to categorise this kind of data for easier use ?
* How to access the cluster, and is it possible to filter the data within the cluster?
* Are we supposed to ask Prof. Martin Jaggi for the Twitter dataset ?
